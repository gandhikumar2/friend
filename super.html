      Carl Nielsen (1865â€“1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and
      violinist, widely recognized as his country's greatest composer.
      Brought up by poor, musically talented parents, he attended the
      Royal Conservatory in Copenhagen from 1884 through 1886, and
      premiered his Op 1, Suite for Strings at the age of 23. The
      following year, he began a 16-year stint as a second violinist
      in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the
      conductor <span class="textcolor">Johan Svendsen, and later
        taught at the Royal Danish Academy</span> of Music from
        1916 until his death. While his symphonies, concertos and
        choral music are now internationally acclaimed
      , Nielsen's career and personal life
      were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music.
      The works he composed between 1897
      and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his "psychological" period,
      resulting mainly from a turbulent
      marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is
      especially noted for his six
      symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute
      and clarinet.
       For many years, he appeared
       on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in
       Odense
      documents his life and that of his wife. Many performances of his
